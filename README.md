# ABLF_SOC_benchmark

This repository is a comprehensive compilation of files for the controller design and optimization of a nonlinear brushless DC motor. In this project, we design a controller for a brushless DC motor using assymetric barrier Lyapunov function (ABLF), backstepping and dynamic surface control (DSC). Then we applied a supervisory layer on the ABLF as a self optimizing control (SOC) to reduce steady state error. The SOC is based on the Nelder-Mead gradient free optimization algorithm. This is an online optimization algorithm. An adapted version of the Nelder-Mead - Globalised Constrained Nelder-Mead (GCNM) - was employed to optimize the steady state performance.

The attached files can be used to verify the obtained results - performance assessment.
